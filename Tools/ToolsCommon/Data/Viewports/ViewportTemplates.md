however after discussion with derammo, as of 2021/22, the parent is dormant and changes in Helios are ahead of this nominated parent.  
Additions can either be made to ViewportTemplates.json or a new file with the name in the following format ViewportTemplates_*.json.

New ViewportTemplates_*.json files are not cumulative, they should only contain the additions.

The files named ViewportTemplates_*.json are changes that are merged for
DCS releases starting at specific versions to account for changes in which 
files need to be patched.
